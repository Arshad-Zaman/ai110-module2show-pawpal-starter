# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.

## 🛠️ Implementation Summary

I built four classes in `pawpal_system.py`: Owner, Pet, Task, and Scheduler.

An Owner holds a list of Pets and can get every task across all of them with `get_all_tasks()`. A Pet holds its own list of Tasks and can add or remove them. A Task stores its description, scheduled time, duration, priority, recurrence, and completion status, and can check for time conflicts with another task.

The Scheduler is the brain. It calls `owner.get_all_tasks()` to pull tasks from every pet at once, sorts them by priority, then fills a time budget greedily, keeping tasks until the available minutes run out. `explain_plan()` turns the result into a readable "Today's Schedule" list. `main.py` wires this together and prints that schedule to the terminal.

## 🖥️ Sample Output

Paste a sample of your app's CLI or Streamlit output here so a reader can see what a generated plan looks like:

```
$ python main.py
Today's Schedule:
- Morning walk for Biscuit (30 min, high priority)
- Evening walk for Biscuit (30 min, high priority)
- Feeding for Whiskers (10 min, medium priority)
```

## 🧪 Testing PawPal+

```bash
# Run the full test suite:
pytest

# Run with coverage:
pytest --cov
```

## 📐 Smarter Scheduling

> Fill in once you've implemented scheduling logic.

| Feature | Method(s) | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Task sorting | | e.g., by priority, duration |
| Filtering | | e.g., skip tasks if time runs out |
| Conflict handling | | e.g., overlapping time slots |
| Recurring tasks | | e.g., daily vs. weekly |
